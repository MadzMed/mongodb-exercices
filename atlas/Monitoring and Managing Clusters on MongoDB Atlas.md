## Objective:

Students will learn how to use MongoDB Atlas tools to monitor and manage their deployed clusters.

## Prerequisites:

- A MongoDB Atlas account
- A cluster deployed on MongoDB Atlas
- Basic understanding of MongoDB Atlas dashboard and features

## Steps:

1. **Log in to MongoDB Atlas:**

    - Click on the cluster you want to monitor and manage.

3. **Monitor Cluster Performance:**

    - Explore the various monitoring tools available in the Atlas dashboard:
            
            - **Metrics:** View real-time metrics for your cluster, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.
    
            - **Performance Advisor:** Get recommendations for improving performance based on the current usage patterns of your cluster.
    
            - **Real-Time Performance Panel:** Monitor key metrics in real-time and identify any performance issues.

4. **Set Up Alerts:**

    - Click on the "Alerts" tab in the left sidebar to configure alerts for your cluster.
    
    - Define alert conditions based on metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.
    
    - Specify the notification channels (e.g., email, SMS) for receiving alerts.

    ### Example Alert Setup:
        - Navigate to the "Alerts" section under the "Settings" tab.
